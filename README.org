#+title: configs

These are my personal configs. Although I am not *100* % proud of them, they get the job done, and github provides me with a free way to store them; therefore, why wouldn't I share them?

- *Disclaimer:* The background is not mine, therefore I will not share it within this git-repo.

*There are currently three configs:*
 * an i3-config
 * the sway version of said config.
 * and grey-beard-wm (emacs)
 * /more soon to come/

- The emacs config *will not work* properly without installation of addition packages. I would also advise compiling emacs from source with SQLite (org-roam back end), Dynamic Module Support (a doom-emacs suggestion), and Native-Compilation (also a doom-emacs suggestion).

This repository is a WIP and may forever stay a work in progress. That is for one reason: As an emacs user, you create problems you never had before and you will continue to do so until the end of time.
